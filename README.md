H.O.M.E. (Hexagonal Open Modular Environment) Lab is a Mars analog habitat for human spaceflight to the Red Planet, designed pursuing standards of high liveability and implementing principles of layout modularity.

INTRODUCTION

In the last years, NASA and other space organizations realized many tests to simulate an extraterrestrial environment on Earth and to experiment efficient ways of cohabitation. 
Examples of this are MDRS (Mars Desert Research Station) from the Mars Society and HI-SEAS from NASA.
What emerged from these experiments, as well from psychological studies on astronauts of ISS, is that the stress of being in an enclosed space with a small group of people for a long period can result in numerous problems, such as cognitive decline, depression and interpersonal conflicts.

For this reason, we found in this challenge an important problem to solve in order to allow in the next decades mankind to colonize other planets.

Therefore, we designed our own research base, H.O.M.E. Lab, pursuing not only the objective of granting its inhabitants a high liveability, but also trying to develop a structure easy to expand and remodulate and based on principles of environmentally friendliness and self-sustainability.


H.O.M.E. LAB

Overview

H.O.M.E. (Hexagonal Open Modular Environment) Lab is an innovative solution for an isolated research base.

It is a honeycomb-structure hab, divided into different hexagonal compartment modules.

H.O.M.E. is designed to grant people inside it a comfortable place to stay and to be easy to set-up and expand, while being totally green. In fact, its key feature are:

high index of liveability for 6 people;
designed to reduce psychological stress;
easy to set-up structure and possibility to add new modules or change the current configuration at any time;
adoption of eco-friendly solution for heating, power source and waste management.
According to these feature, our basic habitat, for 6 people, is made up of:

6 personal rooms
1 laboratory (divided into a clean room and a dirty room)
1 clinic room
2 bathrooms
1 open space in the centre, containing a living room, a kitchen and a relax room.
